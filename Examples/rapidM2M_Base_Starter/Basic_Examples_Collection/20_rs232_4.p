 * Extended "UART" Example
 *
 * Receives data via the UART interface and scans it for data frames that start with the character "+" and 
 * end either with a carriage return or line feed. The received data is issued again immediately after receiving 
 * it via the UART interface. If a complete data frame was received, a string is created that is composed as follows: 
 * "UartRx (<data frame received via UART>) <number of characters of data frame> OK".
 * This string is then issued via the console and the UART interface. The received data frame is also evaluated as 
 * follows:
 *  "on":    LED 2 is turned on
 *  "off":   LED 2 is turned off   
 *  "switch":LED 2 is toggled
 *
 * Only compatible with rapidM2M M2xx and rapidM2M M3
 * Special hardware circuit necessary
 * Recommendation: use rapidM2M Base Starter
 *
 * @version 20190508
