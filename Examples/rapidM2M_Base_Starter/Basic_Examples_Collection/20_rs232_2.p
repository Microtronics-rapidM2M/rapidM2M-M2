 * Extended "UART" Example
 *
 * Receives data via the UART interface and scans it for data frames that start with the character "+" and 
 * end either with a carriage return or line feed. If a complete data frame was received, a string is created 
 * that is composed as follows: "UartRx (<data frame received via UART>) <number of characters of data frame> OK".
 * This string is then issued via the console and the UART interface.
 *
 * Only compatible with rapidM2M M2xx and rapidM2M M3
